//Arrow functions are a more concise way to write a function in TypeScript. They are also called lambda functions in other languages. Arrow functions are always anonymous functions. They are defined using a pair of parentheses, followed by an arrow token (=>), which is followed by the function body.
const doSomething = (person: string, age: number, isFunny: boolean) => {};
//correct
doSomething("Prasanna", 25, true);
//wrong
doSomething("Prasanna", 25, 354);
